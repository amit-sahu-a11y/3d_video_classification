# 3d_video_classification
This project focuses on classifying human actions in videos using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN). Unlike standard 2D CNNs that analyze individual frames, 3D CNNs capture both spatial and temporal features by processing video clips as 3D volumes. The model was trained on the UCF101 dataset, which contains over 13,000 video clips across 101 action categories.

Key features of the project include:

Preprocessing videos into fixed-size frame sequences

Designing and training a 3D CNN for action recognition

Evaluating model accuracy and performance

Deploying the model using a Flask web app that allows users to upload videos and get real-time predictions

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in video classification and provides a practical example of deploying ML models in web applications.
